# canvasbot

Discord slash commands that utilize the Canvas API to retrieve course information and assignments! This repository demonstrates how to leverage the Discord development platform to connect with different services and build useful and meaningful applications (example from [acmcsufoss](https://github.com/acmcsufoss)'s Fall 2024 Discord Workshop).
